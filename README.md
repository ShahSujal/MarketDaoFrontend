# **Stakeyards**

Welcome to Stakeyards â€“ a decentralized Web3 platform that allows investors to create their own dApps where pitchers (users) can pitch profitable investment ideas. Stakeyards fosters collaboration between multiple investors within a single dApp, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. With governance tokens, decentralized communication via Detalks, and crypto-based campaigns, Stakeyards provides a unique, interactive investment experience.


## Features

- Investor dApp
Create Custom dApps: Investors can create their own decentralized apps (dApps) to attract pitchers who want to propose investment ideas.
Collaborate with Multiple Investors: Investors can invite others to join their dApp, pooling resources for more significant investment opportunities.
Pitching System
Submit Investment Proposals: Pitchers can submit detailed proposals for investment opportunities (e.g., upcoming tokens, startups) and collaborate with investors.
Collateral-Based Approval: Pitchers must provide a portion of collateral when making a pitch. If a pitch goes wrong after approval, 40% of the collateral is deducted and distributed to the investors.

- Investment Sharing:
 Investors can pool their funds together to support a pitch, splitting the capital required for investment.
Campaigns
Brand Promotion: Companies can create campaigns to promote their products through social media (YouTube, Twitter, etc.).
Quest Requirements: To participate in a campaign, questers (participants) must meet specific requirements (e.g., minimum subscribers on social media).
Crypto Rewards: Questers who complete campaign tasks successfully earn cryptocurrency rewards.
Detalks
Decentralized Chat System: Detalks allows pitchers and investors to communicate and collaborate in a secure, decentralized manner after a pitch is approved.
Real-Time Discussions: Investors and pitchers can use Detalks to discuss investment details, negotiate terms, and make decisions in real time.

- Governance Token & Collateral

Governance Token: Decisions within dApps, such as pitch approvals, are made through governance tokens. The more tokens staked, the greater the decision-making power.
Collateral for Investment: Investors must provide governance tokens as collateral when approving a pitch. Successful pitches reward pitchers with these governance tokens, allowing them to become investors once they reach a threshold.
